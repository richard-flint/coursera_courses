# coursera_courses

This repository contains scripts I have written to complete the (extended) exercises in coursera courses, including logistic regression algorithms for classifying spam emails and neural networks for digit image recognition. I usually code in Python, even if the course uses another language (e.g. Octabe/Matlab), as this is language used most frequently in my area of work.
